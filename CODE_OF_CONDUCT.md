# Code of Conduct

Any contributor of the IPv8 project (by posting an issue or by contributing code) is expected to follow the following 3 rules.
In case of minor transgressions you will be warned.
Major transgressions will result in banishment from this project.
Administrators reserve the right to judge the severity of your transgression: it is not up for debate.

### 1. Abide by the Golden Rule.

Examples of violations include:

 - Posting non-constructive issues (e.g. posting an issue titled "I don't like you" without content).
 - Excessive trolling (e.g. to the point of violating rule 2 and 3).
 - Aggression (e.g. swearing at others or sexual intimidation).
 - Not respecting someone's time (e.g. posting exceptionally long issues or linking to unrelated resources).

Violations of this nature will **usually result in a warning and an edit or removal of your original content and may be accompanied by a ban**.

### 2. Respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Examples of violations include judging contributions based on:

 - Racism.
 - Sexism.
 - Political or theological views.
 
Violations of this nature are usually criminalized by law and will **always result in a ban without warning**.
The offending content will be removed.

### 3. Be professional and scientific.

IPv8 should be a safe space for development, free from societal pressures and political games.

Examples of violations include:

 - Changing code without fixing a bug or implementing a feature (e.g. including a new dependency because "everyone else is using it"). This leads to edit wars, see also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars.
 - Gaming GitHub metrics (e.g. insisting on being the one to merge  a Pull Request to get a larger amount of line changes).
 - Being pedantic or belittling when giving feedback (e.g. insulting someone's education when pointing out a flaw).
 - Ungracefully receiving feedback (e.g. closing an unrelated Pull Request if your changes did not get accepted).
 - Administrator rights abuse (e.g. not adhering to the contributing guidelines "because you're an administrator").

Violations of this nature will **usually result in a warning and an edit of your original content**. But, in extreme cases, **may also result in a ban**.
